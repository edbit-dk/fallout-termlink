Clearance: Overseer Eyes Only

CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL
OVERSEER EYES ONLY | VIOLATION VTP-01011

The social experiment of vault 101 is,
to grant the Overseers unlimited authority 
over a Vault intended to remain closed - indefinitely.

Under no circumstance is the experiment to be disrupted.
This includes the adminstration of life-saving measures.
Your population and staff is also considered expendable. 
Insubordination or attemps to evacuate prematurely 
are capital violations and should be met with lethal force. 
Composting is the preferred method for cadaver disposal.
