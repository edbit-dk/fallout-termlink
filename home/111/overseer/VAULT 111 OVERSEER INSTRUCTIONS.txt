OVERSEER EYES ONLY | VIOLATION VTP-01011

Vault 111 is designed to test the long-term
effects of suspended animation on unaware, human
subjects. Your staff will be on short-term
assignment to monitor basic cardiopulmonary and
cognitive functions. Long-term monitoring will be
handled remotely by Vault-Tec technicians.

Under no circumstance is suspension to be disrupted.
This includes the administration of life-saving measures.
Your staff is also considered expendable. 
Insubordination or attemps to evacuate prematurely 
are capital violations. Unused cryogenic pods are 
the preferred method for cadaver disposal.
